MVC (Model-View-Controller) TDD(Test Driven Development)

Spring MVC is Java-based web framework built on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, part of the larger Spring Framework ecosystem. It separates the Model
(application data), View (presentation layer), and Controller (business logic) to promote cleaner, maintainable, and testable code.

At its core, DispatcherServlet(it is a class) acts as the Front Controller, intercepting all incoming HTTP requests, delegating them to appropriate controllers, and resolving the correct view for rendering.

Key Components

Model: Holds application data, often as POJOs or DTDs.

View: Renders the model data, typically using JSP, JSTL, Thymeleaf, or FreeMarker.

Controller: Handles requests, processes data, and returns a ModelAndView object.

ViewResolver: Maps logical view names to actual view files. (i.e. redirect to corresponding UI )

HandlerMapping: Determines which controller method should handle a request.


@RequestMapping(value="/") -> it is the page that is to be redirected (i.e. the default page)

filter->co.ntier -> it will define predefined MVC template


PROJECT CREATION

1) File new -> Maven Project -> in filter, just type -> co.ntier -> 
	ArtifactId: SprMvcEx
	package:com.java.mvc

2) If red color shows right click on project -> click Build Path -> Configure Build path -> click libraries -> remove the JRE 1.6  and  add library -> click JRE system library 
-> click execution environment and click the dropdown and select the last one that is JavaSE-1.8 and click finish -> apply and close

3) The HTML code is in web-inf -> views -> home.jsp

4) To run the application -> right click on the project and run on server.

All UI pages must be in Views folder.

MVC -> Loosely coupled and tightly integrated
